    <h1>Finally, an employee that <em>won't</em> ruin your business.</h1>
    <p>
        I pride myself on my ability to be a mostly non-destructive productivity agent in any
        workplace environment. I've destroyed only a trivial number of revenue streams and
        have remained a relatively innocuous business entity with minimal need for material
        concessions. I produce all my own blood, and I can ride a bike. No further caveats required.

    <p>Are you currently hiring? Good for you. Good for me.</p>
    <h3>There are three main benefits to hiring me:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>business acumen</li>
        <li>access to exclusive DLC</li>
        <li>bigger muscles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>I can also count <strong>real</strong> good. <i>Par exemple:</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Several</li>
        <li>Foursies</li>
        <li>Half ten</li>
        <li>Final number</li>
        <li>The Forbidden Zone</li>
    </ol>
